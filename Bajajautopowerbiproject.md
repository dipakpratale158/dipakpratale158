Power BI Sales Dashboard â€“ Vistaar Project
Role: Power BI Developer /Data Analyst
Tools Used: Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Python, SQL, Excel,ETL,Data modeling , power pivote

Project Description:
Designed and implemented an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze sales performance for the Vistaar project, focusing on key metrics such as total sales, product margins, regional performance, and dealer performance. The dashboard enabled sales managers to track performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. Additionally, implemented automation for generating regional sales reports using Python.



Explanation of Key Additions:
Top 5 & Bottom 5 Dealers / Top 10 & Bottom 10 ASDs: In this section, you're showcasing your ability to apply ranking logic within Power BI. The use of RANKX and other DAX functions would be key here. These rankings help visualize which dealers and ASDs are performing best and worst, offering actionable insights for sales improvement.

Rural vs Urban Performance: This demonstrates your ability to split data based on geographical segments, providing insights into regional differences and performance trends between rural and urban areas. This is important for understanding market dynamics.

Automating Regional Reports with Python: This is an impressive aspect that highlights your technical proficiency. Python can be used to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of regional data, format it for Power BI, and ensure the data is consistent across reports. It shows you can go beyond Power BI's native functionality and automate the reporting process across different regions, thus saving significant time and efferot

Key Responsibilities:
To develop a custom visual report in Power BI where users can select row-wise or column-wise data and dynamically display the selected report based on user input, Developed dynamic measures and calculated columns in Power BI using DAX to perform calculations like total sales, profit margins, and regional performance.
Top 5 & Bottom 5 Dealers: Implemented DAX logic to identify the top 5 and bottom 5 performing dealers based on sales performance, helping the team focus on high performers and those needing improvement.
Top 10 & Bottom 10 ASDs (Area Sales Dealers): Created DAX measures to rank ASDs by performance and visualize the top 10 and bottom 10 performers, enhancing decision-making on resource allocation.
Rural vs Urban Performance: Designed calculations and visuals to compare sales performance between rural and urban areas, helping the business identify geographical performance trends.
Automated regional sales reports for all regions using Python. Integrated Python scripts to extract, process, and format data from different regions, saving time and ensuring consistency across reports.
Created dynamic visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPI indicators to track sales across different dimensions, including by region, product category, and time period.
Designed calculated columns for performance categorization, such as classifying dealers into different performance tiers (high, medium, low).
Achievements:
