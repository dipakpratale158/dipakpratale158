Data Cleaning with Power Query: The initial step involves cleaning the data using Power Query. This includes tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, renaming columns, and transforming the data to fit your analysis needs. For instance, you might need to standardize date formats, convert text to proper case, or merge data from different sources.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Once the data is cleaned, you proceed with data analysis and visualization. You can use Power BI's visualization tools to create insightful reports and dashboards. For instance, you can visualize sales data by course, month, year, quarter, week, or day. You can also create charts, graphs, and tables to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.

Interactive Filtering with Slicers: To facilitate easy identification of key metrics and insights, you can add slicers (or menu cards) to your report. These slicers allow users to filter the data dynamically, making it easier to focus on specific courses, time periods, or other dimensions. For example, users can filter the report by course name to see which courses are performing the best.

Collection Analysis: You can also analyze collection data to identify trends and patterns in payment collections. This may include distinguishing between fresh collections (payments received within a certain timeframe) and post-dated check (PDC) collections. By visualizing collection data over time and by different dimensions (e.g., counselor-wise), you can identify areas of focus and trends in payment collections.

Comparison and Target Setting: Using DAX queries, you can calculate metrics such as month-over-month or year-over-year growth in sales or collections. You can compare current performance with previous periods to track progress and set targets. For example, you can create a DAX query to compare the current month's sales or collections with the previous month or the same month in the previous year.
