Running Total nd
ROWS Clause: Syntax and Options
The purpose of the ROWS clause is to specify the window frame in relation to the current row. The syntax is:

ROWS BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound

The bounds can be any of these five options:

UNBOUNDED PRECEDING – All rows before the current row.
n PRECEDING – n rows before the current row.
CURRENT ROW – Just the current row.
n FOLLOWING – n rows after the current row.
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING – All rows after the current row.

RUNNING TOTAL range wise if duplicate first count oll and then same
SELECT  c8,
sum(c8) over(ORDER BY c8 RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
as runningtotal
FROM samplevaishnavi2


or
SELECT C8,
sum(c8) over(ORDER by c8) as runnningtotal
FROM samplevaishnavi2
or
running sum row wise
SELECT c8,
sum(c8) over(ORDER BY c8 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
as runningtotal
FROM samplevaishnavi2



average
SELECT c8,
sum(c8) over(ORDER BY c8 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND  UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) 
as AVARAGE
FROM samplevaishnavi2


SELECT c8,
sum(c8) over(ORDER BY c8 ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) 
as AVARAGE

FROM samplevaishnavi2



GROUPWISE GROUPDESIDER

SELECT c8,C2,
ntile(3) over(PARTITION BY C2 ORDER BY c8) 
as  GROUPSOFSALLARY
FROM samplevaishnavi2


Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when defining window frames with the ROWS clause:

The window frame is evaluated separately within each partition.
The default option depends on if you use ORDER BY:
With ORDER BY, the default frame is RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW.
Without ORDER BY, the default frame is ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.
If one of your bounds is a current row, you can skip specifying this bound and use a shorter version of the window frame definition:
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING is the same as BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW.
n PRECEDING is the same as BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW.
n FOLLOWING is the same as BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND n FOLLOWING.
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING is the same as BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.
